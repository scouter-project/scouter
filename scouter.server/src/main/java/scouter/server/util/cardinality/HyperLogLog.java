/**
 * Java implementation of HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm from this paper:
 * <p/>
 * http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf
 * <p/>
 * HLL is an improved version of LogLog that is capable of estimating the
 * cardinality of a set with accuracy = 1.04/sqrt(m) where m = 2^b. So we can
 * control accuracy vs space usage by increasing or decreasing b.
 * <p/>
 * The main benefit of using HLL over LL is that it only requires 64% of the
 * space that LL does to get the same accuracy.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation implements a single counter. If a large (millions) number
 * of counters are required you may want to refer to:
 * <p/>
 * http://dsiutils.dsi.unimi.it/
 * <p/>
 * It has a more complex implementation of HLL that supports multiple counters
 * in a single object, drastically reducing the java overhead from creating a
 * large number of objects.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation leveraged a javascript implementation that Yammer has
 * been working on:
 * <p/>
 * https://github.com/yammer/probablyjs
 * <p>
 * Note that this implementation does not include the long range correction
 * function defined in the original paper. Empirical evidence shows that the
 * correction function causes more harm than good.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Users have different motivations to use different types of hashing functions.
 * Rather than try to keep up with all available hash functions and to remove
 * the concern of causing future binary incompatibilities this class allows
 * clients to offer the value in hashed int or long form. This way clients are
 * free to change their hash function on their own time line. We recommend using
 * Google's Guava Murmur3_128 implementation as it provides good performance and
 * speed when high precision is required. In our tests the 32bit MurmurHash
 * function included in this project is faster and produces better results than
 * the 32 bit murmur3 implementation google provides.
 * </p>
